## About
- This is only example, app have some mistakes with GUI, but can work.
- You can make events with your friends or colab work for freelance
- Use server for start, use static ip or vpn bridge to your friend `188.168.34.200:2112';
- And open setup app after setup.exe on another computers (Now he coonect only to my ip, you can switch ip in main.cpp,sourse and rebuild on QT7)
